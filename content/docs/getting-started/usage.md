Tower can be accessed or deployed three ways:

  * **Hosted**: The hosted version of Tower is available free of charge at [tower.nf](https://tower.nf). This version is for individuals, academics and organizations that want to get setup fast. It is the recommended way for users to become familiar with Tower. The service is hosted by Seqera Labs.

  * **Community deployment**: Installation of the Tower community edition can be performed on a user's own system. The community edition has basic features for the monitoring of pipelines by an individual user.

  * **Enterprise deployment**: Deployment of the fully-featured Tower application in an organization's own cloud or on-premise environment. This deployment option is supported by Seqera Labs and is recommended for production environments.
