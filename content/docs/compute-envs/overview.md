## Introduction

Tower uses the concept of **Compute Environments** to define the execution platform where a pipeline will run.

Tower supports launching of pipelines into **AWS Batch**, **Google Cloud**, **IBM LSF**, and **Slurm** with many more in development.

Each compute environment must be configured to enable Tower to submit tasks. You can read more on how to set up each environment using the links below.

## Setup guides

The following sections describe how to set up each of the available compute environments.

* [AWS Batch](/docs/compute-envs/aws-batch/)
* [Google Cloud](/docs/compute-envs/google-cloud/)
* [IBM LSF](/docs/compute-envs/lsf/)
* [Slurm](/docs/compute-envs/slurm/)

## Select a default compute environment

If you have more than one **Compute Environment**, you can select which one will be used by default when launching a pipeline.
